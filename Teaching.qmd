# Teaching 

The following summarizes courses I have developed or taught for universities, professional development courses, conference mini-courses, and self-guided learning. Like my analytical projects, I take a highly collaborative approach to instruction, and most classes are co-developed with complementary expertise. At present, only brief course descriptions are provided, but syllabi and course materials will be uploaded in the future.

**Field Experiences in Natural Infrastructure**

Co-developed with [Dr. Brian Bledsoe](https://bledsoe.engr.uga.edu/) and taught by Bledsoe and McKay in Fall 2023 and Fall 2025.

ENGR 8990 (1 credit hours), College of Engineering, University of Georgia. 

The course covers various topics related to the planning, design, and execution of nature-based solutions for water resource management. Students explore these topics through fieldwork components, engaging in hands-on activities, and gaining practical experience. Field sites around Athens are visited to observe and study the interaction of natural systems and infrastructure. These activities aim to deepen understanding of concepts discussed in other UGA courses on natural infrastructure and bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. The course also offers a unique opportunity for students to collaborate with professionals, experts, and local stakeholders involved in diverse ecosystems.

Co-developed and taught by Dr. Kyle McKay and [Dr. Brett Branco](https://srijb.org/home/staff/) in Fall 2024.

EESC 7903G (3 credit hours), Earth and Environmental Science program, Brooklyn College, CUNY. 

This seminar-based course will explore the growing use of nature-based solutions in cities, which are often proposed in the context of simultaneously managing multiple crises related to biodiversity loss, climate change, aging infrastructure, and inequity of natural hazards. Students will explore these topics through reading peer-reviewed literature, agency and project reports, and other resources on the subject. The instructors will guide the class through a critical examination of NBS and their efficacy for accomplishing societal goals, challenges in project execution, and scientific uncertainties. When possible, discussions will include practitioners working in this space, who can provide insights on career trajectories, personal experiences, and disciplinary expertise. This interdisciplinary-oriented course is intended for students from multiple disciplines including environmental sciences, physical sciences, ecology, environmental design, natural resources, marine sciences, anthropology, economics, engineering, and other relevant and related fields. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:  

- Define and describe nature-based solutions for addressing urban sustainability challenges.  
- Understand the role of both ecological and built systems in cities.  
- Critically analyze the complex interactions between natural systems and built infrastructure within the context of water resource management.  
- Foster an interdisciplinary approach (and dialog) by integrating knowledge from diverse fields to enhance natural infrastructure practices.

**PIANC Smart Rivers 2025: Sustainable practices for large river management**

[Course website](https://skmckay.github.io/SmartRivers2025)

Co-developed with Drs. Burton Suedel, Calvin Creech, Bernhard Sohngren, and Jos Wieggers. 

Sustainable development of infrastructure systems is an emerging priority worldwide, and nature-based solutions are increasingly applied in navigable waterways to meet infrastructure needs as well as produce social and environmental benefits. This short course covers how science-based guidance can inform decisions about waterborne infrastructure projects for two common areas of practice: sustainable sediment management and technical-biological bank protection. Participants learn about the broader context for sustainable waterway management as well as technical guidance for executing these two types of nature-based solutions.

**Freshwater Science 2023: Tools and Techniques to Inform Dam Removal Decisions**

Co-developed with Dr. Suman Jumani.

Aquatic barriers such as dams, weirs, levees, and culverts provide many societal services. However, they are increasingly being removed for myriad reasons such as economic or structural obsolescence, public safety or liability, prohibitive repair costs, reduced return on investment, and increasing support for river restoration and species conservation. These projects can be complex to plan and execute due to many technical, logistical, and communication challenges. This short course seeks to familiarize attendees with the context for dam removal and tools available to inform these decisions. Specifically, we seek to:  

- Familiarize participants with a range of goals and motivations for dam removal.  
- Describe techniques for quantitatively assessing two common constraints with these projects (sediment release and cost estimation).  
- Demonstrate a suite of methods for prioritizing barrier removal at the watershed scale based on multiple criteria and objectives.  
- Provide users with lessons learned from dam removal case studies.

**SEDHYD 2023: Natural Infrastructure Design for Riverine Environments**

Co-developed with Dr. Aubrey Harris, Dr. Garrett Menichino, Eddie Brauer.

Natural infrastructure generally involves a family of infrastructure planning and design approaches that emphasize the need to expand the scope of benefits and reduce unintentional costs with a particular focus on social and environmental outcomes. These holistic management actions go by many names, including nature-based solutions, natural and nature-based features, and Engineering With Nature. The river engineering community has long embraced many of these practices, although the science and practice of natural infrastructure design has grown dramatically in recent years. This short course seeks to generally advance attendees’ knowledge of Engineering With Nature® practice in rivers with the following specific objectives:  

- Improve understanding of how conventional infrastructure and natural infrastructure can be integrated to do the right project, and do the project right.  
- Familiarize participants with recent guidelines on natural infrastructure including the USACE International Guidelines on Natural and Nature-based Features.  
- Expose participants to riverine case studies to improve technical understanding of natural infrastructure projects, processes, and benefits.  
- Build awareness of opportunities for expanding acceptance and deployment of natural infrastructure.

**Using R for ecological modeling in USACE**

Co-developed with Dr. Ed Stowe for self-directed learning.

[Course website](https://usace-wrises.github.io/USACE.EcoMod.Training/) with modules for learning and applying R to USACE ecological modeling challenges.

Ecological modeling within USACE is historically a spreadsheet-based activity featuring deterministic habitat models. However, the ecological modeling capacity of USACE biologists can be greatly improved by incorporating modern data science practices, especially the uptake of R, a programming language that is used in the majority of ecological research being conducted today. R promotes research that is well-documented, reproducible, interdisciplinary, and extensible. R also works on all kinds of data, produces high-quality graphics, has a broad supportive network of users, and is easier to learn than ever before. This training series focuses on teaching USACE biologists and other practitioners how to use R for ecological modeling.
